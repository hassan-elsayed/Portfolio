						<section><strong>Timeline:</strong> Kublai Khan (1215 - 1294) was the fifth Great Khan of the Mongol Empire started by Genghis Khan. He reigned from 1260 to 1294, and the Mongols also knew him as Setsen Khan, which meant "Wise Khan," due to his political savvy. He was the fourth son of Tolui, and the grandson of Genghis. He was also the first foreign emperor to conquer all of China. Thanks to Samuel Taylor Coleridge's 1797 poem, Kubla Khan, Kublai Khan is a well-known figure today.</section>

Due to inexperience, Kublai initially mismanages the province, which leads to corrupt officials and over taxation. Kublai Khan returns and reforms the government. This becomes his first real experience with politics.

He becomes his advisor, and even names Kublai's son for him - calling him Zhenjin. He later introduces Kublai to Liu Bingzhong, a former Taoist and now Buddhist monk, who takes over as Kublai's advisor when Haiyun has to return to his temple. He also adds another Chinese scholar named Zhao Bi to his entourage as an advisor. These advisors act in formative ways to the young man throughout his life.

                                          The fourth Great Khan, Guyuk, dies. His rival, Batu, calls a kurultai in his own territory, which his rivals refuse to attend, but he then refuses to take the role of the next Great Khan. Instead, he nominates Mongke, Kublai's older brother. This causes a division in the empire between the descendents of Ogedei on one side, and Mongke and the descendents of Genghis's other son, Tolui. So, Mongke institutes a bloody purge of the Ogedei line, which consolidates his power.

Before he is able to return, however, Ariq Boke holds a kurultai - the meeting of royal families to decide the succession. Taking advantage of Kublai's absence, and that of their fourth brother, Hulagu, Ariq Boke is named Great Khan. Halagu and Kublai both oppose this kurultai, despite its apparent legality. Kublai returns to his own Chinese territories and, despite a lack of the ruling Mongolian families, holds his own kurultai, which names him Great Khan. This leads to the Touid Civil War between the forces of Ariq Boke and Kublai.
